Delete a folder:
rm -r folder_name — removes a directory and its contents. Add -f to force delete: rm -rf folder_name.

Go up one directory:
cd .. — moves you to the parent directory of the current location.

Change directory using relative path:
cd ./path — moves into a folder named path that is inside your current directory (. refers to "here").
