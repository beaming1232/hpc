**Note:**
## Before executing any code it is super important to update Mingw64 to latest version. 
Download here: [Win32](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/14.2.0posix-12.0.0-ucrt-r3/winlibs-i686-posix-dwarf-gcc-14.2.0-llvm-19.1.7-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r3.zip)  [Win64](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/14.2.0posix-12.0.0-ucrt-r3/winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-14.2.0-llvm-19.1.7-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r3.zip) <br>
We are performing operations on system threads so old mingw may not work.

## Index:
**Experiment No. 1:**<br>
Design and implement Parallel breadth First Search and Depth First Search based on existing algorithms using OpenMP. Use a Tree or an undirected graph for BFS and DFS.<br>

**Experiment No. 2:**<br>
Linear regression by using Deep Neural network: Implement Boston housing price prediction problem by Linear regression using Deep Neural network. Use Boston House price Prediction dataset. <br>

**Experiment No. 3:**<br>
Write a program to implement Parallel Bubble Sort and Merge sort using OpenMP. Use existing algorithms and measure the performance of sequential and parallel algorithms.<br>

**Experiment No. 4:**<br>
Binary classify- cation using Deep Neural Networks Example: Classify movie reviews into positive" reviews and "negative" revie-ws, just based on the text content of the reviews. Use IMDB dataset.<br>

**Experiment No. 5:**<br>
Implement Min, Max, Sum and Average operations using Parallel Reduction.<br>

**Experiment No. 6:**<br>
Use MNIST Fashion Dataset and create a classifier to classify fashion clothing into categories.<br>

**Experiment No. 7:**<br>
Implement HPC application for AI/ML domain.<br>

**Experiment No. 8:**<br>
Mini Project: Colorizing Old B&W Images: color old black and white images to colorful images.<br>
